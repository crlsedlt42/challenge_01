Week 1 Challenge

### CHALLENGE 1 for CARLOS DLT

I read the calendar wrong and I thought this assignment wasn't due until next Thursday.
In the beginning of class when we discussed the calendar because of the upcoming holidays, I realized how wrong I had my date.
Today I'm going to turn something in so that I don't get a "0" as a grade.
I commented the HTML file, lined them up so that they're easy to find and read.

### WHAT I WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

Listed above are the tasks I believe I got done correctly.

### ITEMS I DIDN'T COMPLETE

WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

I had a hard time finding the accessible alt attributes, which made the first two tasks listed here difficult to complete

The last task seemed straight-forward but didn't have time to complete
