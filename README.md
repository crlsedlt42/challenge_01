# Challenge 1: HTML Elements and Semantics

## Description

This challenge helped understand the concept of refactoring, which is a common practice within the coding industry to improve on existing code without changing the functionality of the code. 
This assigments provides a different perspective on coding because as a web developer, I need to be unbiased and think of people with disabilities being able to view or access my webpages.
Keeping code organizd in structured HTML semantics is critical because I want my code to be understood by others working on projects that are bigger than one webpage.
Recognizing HTML elements and how they need to be organized is a basic skill that needs to be understood and perfected with time in order to succeed in the coding industry.

This assignment is easy but now being in the bootcamp in for 6 weeks I understand the importance of knowing how to read HTML elements because HTML is the foundation of any webpage.

## Installation

This is easy to run, simply open the HTML file in a browser.
Once the webpage is open, the navigation bar will work as needed to show the user article portion of the website.
If for any reason the images don't load properly, the user will see alternative text describing what the images should have displayed.

When this assignment was initially due, I didn't understand the objective but after attending tutoring session I realized how knowledgeable tutors are in this program.

### CHALLENGE 1 for CARLOS DLT

I read the calendar wrong and I thought this assignment wasn't due until next Thursday.
In the beginning of class when we discussed the calendar because of the upcoming holidays, I realized how wrong I had my date.
Today I'm going to turn something in so that I don't get a "0" as a grade.
I commented the HTML file, lined them up so that they're easy to find and read.

### WHAT I WAS ABLE TO COMPLETE

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning

Listed above are the tasks I believe I got done correctly.

### ITEMS I DIDN'T COMPLETE

WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

I had a hard time finding the accessible alt attributes, which made the first two tasks listed here difficult to complete

The last task seemed straight-forward but didn't have time to complete
